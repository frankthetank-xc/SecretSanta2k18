Simple little Arduino Nano project. Plays annoying audio over a speaker and blinks an LED.

Based on the PCM Audio library by Michael Smith http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PCMAudio

PCM arrays generated by converting audio files to 8kHz MP3 files in iTunes and feeding them to the EncodeAudio program from https://github.com/damellis/EncodeAudio
